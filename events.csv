This opposition to the hunt increasingly reflects a narrow, ideological interest, as many mainstream environmental NGOs have expressed support for the Tribe’s proposed hunt and exercise of its treaty-protected right to hunt whales. Thus, despite the substantial adverse effects on the Tribe from the hiatus in whaling caused by the depletion of gray whales by non-Native whalers, despite the fact that the Tribe delayed exercising its Treaty right until the ENP gray whale population returned to healthy numbers, despite the Tribe’s efforts to limit the scope of its hunt and comply with all IWC humane kill requirements, despite the Tribe’s diligent efforts to comply with the extraordinarily complex and time-consuming domestic management process, despite the Tribe’s compliance with additional restrictions resulting from that process, and despite the Tribe’s contributions to the body of scientific knowledge about gray whales, opponents of Makah whaling will likely ensure that the recently issued waiver and any subsequent decisions by NOAA to authorize a Makah hunt – no matter how limited – will be reviewed by United States federal courts. ”</p><p>Source: https://iwc.int/management-and-conservation/whaling/aboriginal/usa/makah-tribe</p>","Makah"
